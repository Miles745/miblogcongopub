Background #In power-drive modulation, the ideal duty ratio is not the same as the duty ratio you can actually output. A real system typically has to satisfy at least these constraints:\nMinimum distinguishable pulse width: very short pulses may be written but not reliably executed. Dead-time / complementary leg safety margin: a safety interval is required to avoid shoot-through. Cycle-boundary continuity: how the end of the current cycle and the start of the next one connect determines whether “pseudo short pulses” appear. If you only do single-cycle, local limiting on one edge, common symptoms are:\npulses that exist “logically” but are unusable in practice, frequent boundary jitter, discontinuities near high duty ratios. 2. Core idea (abstract) #Let the PWM period be \\(T\\), dead-time (or safety margin) be \\(\\tau_d\\), and minimum high/low pulse thresholds be \\(\\tau_{h,\\min},\\tau_{l,\\min}\\).\nInstead of chasing the “geometrically ideal width”, the algorithm searches for an executable width with the following ordering.\n2.1 Stage 1: short-pulse suppression within the current cycle #First, check the candidate pulse width in the current cycle:\nIf width \\(\u003c \\tau_{\\min}\\), mark it non-executable and suppress it. If it is executable, proceed to the next stage. This stage removes pulses that are guaranteed to fail and reduces uncertainty downstream.\n2.2 Stage 2: cross-cycle incoming check #For the “incoming pulse at the beginning of the next cycle”, do not judge it in isolation. Instead, concatenate it with the remaining tail window of the current cycle.\nIn other words, use a two-cycle view (abstractly):\n$$ W_{in} = W_{k,tail} + W_{k+1,head} $$Compare \\(W_{in}\\) against the corresponding minimum threshold, then decide to keep or suppress.\n2.3 Stage 3: correction to the current cycle #Once boundary feasibility is satisfied, apply a limited correction to the end edge of the current cycle. The goal is not “make it as large as possible”, but:\nkeep it executable, keep transitions continuous, stay close to the requested trajectory. One convenient metric is:\n$$ \\Delta = W_{act} - W_{ref} $$where:\n\\(W_{act}\\): effective width after correction, \\(W_{ref}\\): replay width under the same input and same previous state, without correction. When \\(\\Delta\u003e0\\), the correction brings a net gain in effective width (equivalently, an increase in effective duty).\n3. Why it works #3.1 Effectiveness is “more executable”, not “more aggressive” #Each stage starts with feasibility filtering:\nsuppress pulses that are guaranteed to be invalid, check the cross-cycle concatenation, only then correct within a feasible window. This makes it naturally more stable than “output the ideal duty directly”.\n3.2 Smoother behavior near boundaries #Jitter is most likely near high duty ratios, at cycle transitions, or close to thresholds. A two-cycle view reduces sudden flips at boundaries.\n3.3 Quantifiable benefit #\\(\\Delta\\) lets you directly quantify:\nwhich sequences yield net gain, where in the operating range the gain happens, which scenarios trigger correction but still have zero net gain (still useful—it indicates conservative operation at the edge). 4. Practical note (personal logging) #For a personal engineering notebook, a consistent record format helps:\nCase=\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;; Seq=[u(k),u(k+1)]; PrevState=\u0026lt;fixed-prev-state\u0026gt;; W_act=\u0026lt;ticks\u0026gt;; W_ref=\u0026lt;ticks\u0026gt;; Delta=\u0026lt;ticks\u0026gt;; DeltaDuty=\u0026lt;%\u0026gt; Two simple rules:\nCompare only under “same input + same previous state”. Check executability first, then the size of the gain. 5. Summary #Minimum-pulse suppression + correction is essentially a constraint-first output reconstruction:\nnot pursuing mathematically ideal pulse widths, but pursuing engineering executability, continuity, and measurable benefit. That is why it remains stable and useful even in boundary conditions.\n","date":null,"permalink":"https://miles745.github.io/miblogcongopub/posts/pwm_min_pulse_correction/","section":"Blog","summary":"From constraint modeling to two-stage suppression and cross-cycle correction—why this approach stays executable and smooth near boundaries.","title":"PWM Minimum Pulse Suppression \u0026 Cross-Cycle Correction"},{"content":"Congo has full support for Hugo taxonomies and will adapt to any taxonomy set up.
